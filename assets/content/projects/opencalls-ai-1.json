  "content": "[opencalls.ai](https://opencalls.ai) is an experimental platform that automatically scans the internet to collect artistic opportunities, using AI to structure and organize them into a single, searchable database. The goal is to make access to opportunities easier and more democratic for artists, designers, and other cultural workers.\n\nThe software development was carried out together with Antonio Hofmeister Ribeiro. We implemented a complex system that combines large-scale web scraping with LLM-based data flows, which analyze, clean, and structure the collected information. Additional analytics were designed to score the quality of the content and ensure a consistent layer of quality control. Interface design was made by Liudmila SAvelyeva.\n\nThe system is largely automated, and all information is AI-generated from publicly available sources. Users are encouraged to double-check deadlines, eligibility, and application details directly at the official sources linked in the database.\n\nThe platform is still in early development, but it reflects my ongoing interest in building tools that bridge artistic practice, technology, and infrastructure.",
