Through the exploration of interaction and collisions between sounds, images, and shapes of different languages, an abstract environment is formed orbiting the uncertainty of our present time.\n\n![](/img/photo-003.jpg)\n\n![](/img/photo-001.jpg)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/712561027?h=229939b371\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/712561027\">The living body is the center of all politics</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user40750497\">Alberto Harres</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>",
