	"content": "Central is the second show by Companhia Volante focusing on roaming and occupying urban space. Created in a collaborative process with a team of almost twenty artists involved, it premiered in August 2018 on the circuit between Largo da Carioca and Cinelândia, in the center of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe play is structured around research into technology, architecture, landscape, the body, politics and performativity. Each of the five performers dealt with topics of personal interest and dear to the community, including: education; death and the black genocide; consumption; public security and social surveillance; the dance epidemic and women's bodies in irruption. Through a trajectory through the city, which establishes different landscapes, the vehicles develop actions and elaborate encounters with the concrete architecture of the spaces and the symbolic construction of their interests.",
