	"content": "[AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/) is a free, open-source browser extension designed to obfuscate browsing data and protect users from tracking by advertising networks. It also acts as a form of protest against surveillance capitalism, amplifying user discontent with ad networks that violate privacy and promote mass surveillance.\n\nOriginally authored by [Daniel C. Howe](https://rednoise.org/daniel), [Helen Nissenbaum](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/), and [Mushon Zer-Aviv](http://mushon.com/), the project has over 100,000 users across platforms.\n\nI worked on AdNauseam as a software developer from 2020 to 2025. My contributions included implementing key features, maintaining and documenting the codebase, and developing the exhibition version of the project for *[Choose Your Filter!](https://zkm.de/en/2025/02/choose-your-filter)* at ZKM.",
