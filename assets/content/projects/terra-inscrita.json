It stems from memories of the floods and landslides of January 2011 in the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil—an event that left visible scars on the mountains and rivers, as well as on those who inhabit the region, including myself.\n\n5kg of clay were locally extracted, filtered, dried, and transported to Bremen, Germany. This “migrant” piece of terra became the foundation for this material-specific investigation, understood not as a passive material to be shaped, but as an intra-acting agent—the constituting matter of this landscape’s ongoing process of becoming.\n\nCentral to this work is a performative installation where magnetics traverse a pool of clay and water, generating images within this dynamic material field as a metaphor for the scars of the landscape and the sedimenting memories of the community. This machinic gesture mediates between scales and topologies, functioning as a sublimation machine that re-enacts the processes endured by those who lived through these events.",
