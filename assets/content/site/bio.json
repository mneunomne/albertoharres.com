	"content": "I am an Artist and Media-Designer, originally from Brazil and now based in Bremen, Germany, exploring the intersection of art and technology, with language often serving as the core of my work.\n\nConceptually, I focus on creating Archives as a form of artistic inquiry, examining their poetic and political dimensions. These explorations investigate how archives can function as spaces for memory, critique, and speculation.\n\nIn practice, I primarily work with clay and ceramics, integrating them with technical systems, material agency, and the tension between archaism and futurism. By combining hands-on knowledge of traditional techniques with technical expertise in electronics and software development, I explore the interplay between physical and digital realms, uncovering their mutual influence and creative potential.\n\nMy projects have been featured in venues such as Ars Electronica in Linz, the British Academy Summer Showcase in London, the Museum of Modern Art in Salvador, the National Historic Museum in Rio de Janeiro, the Voltaje Festival in Bogotá, and the PixxelPoint Festival in Slovenia, among others. With an MA in Digital Media from HfK Bremen, I continue to refine my approach to artistic research. My achievements include the CyberArts 2019 Prix Ars Electronica Honorary Mention, 1st place Hochschulpreis Digitale Medien 2022, and the Media Futures grant for the project “Edit Wars” in 2022. My work has been presented in exhibitions and festivals across Brazil, Europe, and Latin America.\n",
